Code - Version Control
----------------------

### git

Git is a *distributed* **version control system**. It helps you to keep your software
development work organized. It also helps to come along in **teams**, crunching on
the *same project* (arrr! dare you other guys, why did you change my precious
*main.cpp*!?).

If *version control* is totally **new** to you (that's good, because you are not
[spoiled](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8)) - please refer to a
beginners guide first.
- [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

Since git is *distributed*, no one really needs a server or services like
github.com to *use git*. Actually, there are even very good reasons why one can
use git also for **local** data only, e.g. a master thesis (or your collection of ascii art
dwarf hamster pictures).

Btw, **fun fact warning**: [Linus Torvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds),
yes the nice guy with the pinguin stuff and all that, developed git to maintain
the **Linux kernel**. So that's cool, by definition.

A nice overview about the *humongous* number of tutorials can be found at
[stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/315911/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide)
... but we may like to start with a git **cheat sheet** (is there anyone who knows more
than 1% of all git commands available?)

### git for svn users

If you already used version control systems before, you may enjoy the
[git for svn users crash course](http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html).


git intro - checkout, pull, branch, commit, merge, push
