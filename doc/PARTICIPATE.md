Code - Version Control
----------------------

If you are familiar with git, feel free to jump to our [github workflow](#github-workflow) section.

### git

Git is a *distributed* **version control system**. It helps you to keep your software
development work organized, because it keeps track of *changes* in your project.
It also helps to come along in **teams**, crunching on
the *same project*. Examples:
- Arrr, dare you other guys! Why did you change my precious *main.cpp*, too!?
- Who introduced that awesome block of code? I would like to pay for a beer as a reward.
- Everything is wrong now, why did this happen and when?
- What parts of the code changed since I went on vacation
  (to a conference, phd seminar,
   [mate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate) fridge, ...)?

If *version control* is totally **new** to you (that's good, because you are not
[spoiled](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8)) - please refer to a
beginners guide first.
- [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
- 15 minutes guide at [try.github.io](http://try.github.io)

Since git is *distributed*, no one really needs a server or services like
github.com to *use git*. Actually, there are even very good reasons why one should
use git even for **local** data, e.g. a master thesis (or your collection of ascii art
dwarf hamster pictures).

Btw, **fun fact warning**: [Linus Torvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds),
yes the nice guy with the pinguin stuff and all that, developed git to maintain
the **Linux kernel**. So that's cool, by definition.

A nice overview about the *humongous* number of tutorials can be found at
[stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/315911/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide)
... but we may like to start with a git **cheat sheet** (is there anyone out there who knows more
than 1% of all git commands available?)
- [git-tower.com](http://www.git-tower.com/files/cheatsheet/Git_Cheat_Sheet_grey.pdf) (print the 1st page)
- [github.com - "cheat git" gem](https://help.github.com/articles/git-cheatsheet) (a cheat sheet for the console)

### git for svn users

If you already used version control systems before, you may enjoy the
[git for svn users crash course](http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html).

Anyway, please keep in mind to use git *not* like a centralized version control
system (e.g. *not* like svn). Imagine git as your *own private* svn server
waiting for your commits. Github is more **one of many** *sources for upates*.
