               This is a simulation of a single macro particle representing an electron 
               that collides head-on with a laser pulse. Depending on the momentum 
               of the electron and the wavelength and intensity of the laser, the
               emitted radiation differs. A general description of this simulation 
               can be found in *PauschDipl. A detailed analysis of this single 
               electron simulation can be found in *Pausch13. A theoretical
               study of the emitted radiation in head-on laser electron collisions 
               can be found in *Esarey93.

--- # Run-Time Tests for the Bunch Example

      name:        nonlinear Thomson scattering from a single electron
      description: |
                   This test simulates an electron bunch with a relativistic
                   gamma factor of gamma=5.0 and with a laser with a_0=1.0.
                   The resulting radiation should be boosted in the direction 
                   of the electron's momentum and should contain higher
                   harmonics do to the high laser intensity.
