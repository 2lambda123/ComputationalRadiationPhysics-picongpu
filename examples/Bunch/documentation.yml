               This is a simulation of an electron bunch that collides
               head-on with a laser pulse. Depending on the number of
               electrons in the bunch, their momentum and their distribution
               and depending on the laser wavelength and intensity,
               the emitted radiation differs. A general description of this
               simulation can be found in *PauschDipl. A detailed analysis of
               this bunch simulation can be found in *Pausch13. A theoretical
               study of the emitted radiation in head-on laser electron
               collisions can be found in *Esarey93.

--- # Run-Time Tests for the Bunch Example

  - nonlinearThomsonScattering:
      name:        nonlinear Thomson scattering from an electron bunch Test
      description: |
                   This test simulates an electron bunch with an reltivistic
                   gamma factor of gamma=5.0 with an laser with a_0=1.5.
                   The resulting radiation should scale with the number of 
                   real electrons (incoherent radiation).
